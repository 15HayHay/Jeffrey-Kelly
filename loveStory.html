        <h2>The Journey from Mayfield to Middlefield</h2>
      </span>

      <p>
        Once upon a time, there was a young man and a young lady who both bought a house. Elizabeth bought her house in
        Mayfield Heights, near her family's home. That same year, in 2017, Ben bought a house just a couple of miles
        west,
        in South Euclid, after accepting his first permanent job offer in Mayfield Heights. For six years, Ben and
        Elizabeth visited many of the same churches, stores, and restaurants, traveling the same roads, working in
        nearly
        adjacent buildings for a season, knowing even some of the same people, and they never met each other. The city
        of
        Lyndhurst was between them, but happily, it didn't keep them apart forever!
      </p>
      <p>
        In 2020, Ben began working in Aurora, and as life shifted in that direction, this led to becoming connected
        with,
        and eventually more involved at, Parkside Church. Shortly after, Elizabeth was seeking out new church
        connections
        and community, especially people her age &ndash; this journey also led her to Parkside Church. With the number
        of
        people at Parkside, they did not meet right away. However, in the summer of 2023, Elizabeth had been encouraged
        by
        a friend to come to a game night that Ben regularly attended on Friday nights. This friend ended up not going,
        but
        Elizabeth, being bold and brave, decided to come into a stranger's house and meet some new people. Elizabeth
        came
        to a table where Ben was playing Dutch Blitz with some other friends. Seeing that she was new and feeling shy,
        Ben
        asked Elizabeth if she would like to help by shuffling his cards. Elizabeth was happy to sit down at the table
        and
        help, and she appreciated Ben including her. Ben admired the way Elizabeth was cautious and kind with her words,
        and, right away, noticed her big beautiful brown eyes, observant and caring. Although Dutch Blitz is not a
        favorite game for either of them, Ben still attributes his wins that day to her skillful shuffling.
      </p>
      <p>
        Elizabeth and Ben continued to talk among friends at game nights and after church services. After a couple
        months,
        they began to form a deeper bond. A connection was formed that left both hoping for more.
      </p>
      <p>
        One day, while Ben was at a Tuesday night men's Bible study, he got a text from Hayley saying that Elizabeth
        could
        use help with her garbage disposal. (Hayley also helped us by designing this website &ndash; thank you!) Hayley
        shared Tori's number, and Ben then received Elizabeth's number from Tori, who was Elizabeth's roommate at that
        time. After Bible study, Ben called Elizabeth for the first time. Ben offered to take a quick look at her
        garbage
        disposal on his way home. (Elizabeth is a &quot;let's get it done right now&quot; type of person!) Ben, never
        having been to Elizabeth's house, and also being a man of intentionally-limited technology, had no GPS nor
        internet to guide him, but this did not stop him &ndash; Ben used his old-fashioned street atlas on hand to
        locate
        her street and quickly found her house with no trouble at all. After he promptly solved the jam, Elizabeth
        walked
        Ben to his car. Elizabeth appreciated Ben taking the time to be helpful. During that short visit, she noticed
        that
        Ben was both resourceful and respectful.
      </p>
      <p>
        The next day, Ben was hoping to see Elizabeth at the young adults group, but she didn't make it. On the way
        home,
        Ben got a flat tire. He put his spare tire on and finished driving to his house where he had an extra set of
        tires. Ben was thinking of Elizabeth, so he sent her a picture of the flat tire. Elizabeth called right away to
        check and see if he was okay and if he needed help! Ben was happy to tell her it was already taken care of, and
        she was impressed. On that second phone call, Ben and Elizabeth set up their first date!
      </p>
      <p>
        Ben and Elizabeth's first date was a walk in the park! Yes, literally, it was a walk in the park with Vega Lynn
        (Elizabeth&rsquo;s dog), followed by a late dinner at the local Mexican restaurant: Don Ramon. Both felt
        comfortable being themselves. They connected over liking tea, sharing stories, taking in the sunset, and a
        shared
        interest in caring for kids or those with special needs. Elizabeth thoroughly enjoyed Ben&rsquo;s company, and
        looked forward to getting to know him better. Ben thought it was awesome that Elizabeth came prepared with a
        coupon for the restaurant, and began falling in love with her calming voice and sweet smile. Two days later, Ben
        told a friend that it was the best date he had ever been on in his life!
      </p>
      <p>
        On October 9, 2024, Ben proposed to Elizabeth on the one-year anniversary of their first date. Ben had taken the
        day off of work to prepare and set up, but Elizabeth thought they were just going on a special date after work.
        Before dinner, they had made a plan to stop and see the Great Falls at Viaduct Park together. This particular
        waterfall was special to them because they had both been to the park when they were younger, but had not seen
        the
        large waterfall until they discovered it together. It represents to them the discovery of something new and
        wonderful in a place that wasn't significant before. When they arrived, Ben sang a special song as they
        approached
        the falls. Near the falls, Elizabeth saw the elaborate set up that had been prepared, and recognized Ben's
        blanket
        that they would use at the beach or for outdoor services at church. She suddenly realized that the setup &ndash;
        the candles, the flowers, the raspberries and the sparkling juice &ndash; was for her! They went down closer to
        the falls, and read each other cards that they had prepared. Elizabeth had written a thank you card, recalling
        that the first card Ben had given her was a thank you card, and she read from it (both sides filled and
        overflowing to the back) all the things she had to say thank you for. Ben had prepared a specially-selected card
        with quilling art on the front. The front artwork was of flowers with a green stem and leaves, purple petals,
        and
        yellow peaking out at the center of the flowers, along with a yellow butterfly. Inside this card, Ben told of
        how
        the green, as his favorite color, represented the way in which he desired to support and lift up Elizabeth,
        providing for her needs and being steady for her. He continued to describe how the purple, as her favorite
        color,
        represented Elizabeth and her beauty, and also how the yellow represented the ways in which he hoped their
        relationship would be life giving, whether that be through little ones of their own or through serving others.
        Finally, Ben described how the ground, which was invisible in the artwork, represented Christ, who, though He is
        not seen, is the only foundation &ndash; the only security, stability, and source of life through all seasons,
        in
        whom all must remain in order to be rooted and grow. Ben told Elizabeth then that he took her to a big waterfall
        because he wanted to plan a big day, and he got down on one knee. Elizabeth said, &quot;I love you, yes!&quot;
        when asked the big question. Then, the friends that Ben had arranged to be there in disguise and in hiding
        joined
        to take photos and celebrate! As the sun was setting, Elizabeth and Ben drove off together to their first dinner
        as an engaged couple.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ben and Elizabeth have now been through all kinds of seasons together. One of their deepest lows has been the
        loss
        of Vega, whom they are commemorating and honoring through photos, though she can't be part of their special day.
        Their highs have been many, including the adventure of trips to multiple time zones, the joy of serving together
        at their new home church to help those with special needs, and the excitement of having a new house built. After
        the experiences of traveling in places including the UP of Michigan, North Carolina, Chicago, and even Romania,
        they are both excited about putting down roots together. Elizabeth and Ben are ready to start a new life
        together
        in a new house in a new place. Both are thankful for all their friends, both new and old.

      <!--  Ben and Elizabeth met at Parkside church and fell in love. Ben asked Elizabeth to marry her one fall evening on
      their one year anniversary after a walk in the park. Elizabeth never saw it coming and she squealed in excitement
      and gave a resounding yes as Ben asked her to spend the rest of their lives together. Emerging from a cave were
      excited friends who got to share in such a special moment with them before they went off to dinner. After the
      wedding they plan on moving in to their new house in Middlefield where they will start the next chapter of their
      lives as husband and wife. -->
